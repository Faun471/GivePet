## About project
GivePet allows you to transfer pet ownership to another player. This plugin was made with
ease of use, configurability and simplicity in mind.

## Getting started
There are no required dependencies. To use the plugin, simply download the plugin and put it in your `/plugins` folder.

## How it works
Let's say that you want to give your pet to another player named "Notch", to do so, you can simpy do these steps:
1. Run the command `/givepet request Notch`.
2. Wait for "Notch" to accept the request; he can accept the request by doing `/givepet accept`.
3. Once the request was accepted, you can then right-click the pet that you want to give away.

## Known bugs
As of now, there are no known bugs. If you find any, please create a new issue [here.](https://github.com/Faun471/GivePet/issues)
I will try my best to fix them with the limited free time that I have.
